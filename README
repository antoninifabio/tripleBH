# Kozai Code with orbit-averaged Spin Terms
# Credits: F. Antonini and C. Rodriguez 2017

Code for integrating the secular equations of motions for the three-body problem, including the quadrupole and octupole terms (see Tremaine+2009, Petrovich2015 and Liu+2015)

Also includes relativistic terms for the inner binary, including:  
----1pN Pericenter precession (ala Ford+2000)  
----Gravitational Wave emission (ala Blaes+2002)  
----Spin-Orbit coupling (following Barker and O'Connell 1975)  
----Spin-Spin coupling (same)  
  

set initial conditions in file "input"; units are M_Sun, AU, G=1
compile: gfortran -o LKspin LKspin.f
output vectors are in "out.dat"


You are welcome to use the code in any way you like, though we ask that if you use any results from it in a paper that you cite Rodriguez and Antonini (2018, https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08212) and Antonini et al (2017, https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07142)
